Melissa is a psychotherapist and author of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/No-Touching-Secrets-about-touching-ebook/dp/B0197NAR5S" target="_blank" style="color:midnightblue">No Touching Secrets!</a>. She wanted a website for her private practice, book, and other services she offers. Her main requirements were that it would be simple, professional and easy to navigate. I created this responsive website using the Bootstrap framework coupled with CushyCMS for a lightweight content management system. Rest I used plain HTML, Sass/CSS and some PHP.
